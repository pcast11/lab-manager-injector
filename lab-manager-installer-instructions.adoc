Lab Manager Injection for Testing Instructions
----------------------------------------------

To inject lab manager for testing, you can use the following:

Set up your inventory to point at the specific hosts you need your automation to run against, like the example below:

----
[target]
utility1.multi-utility-00.dynamic.opentlc.com 
utility2.multi-utility-00.dynamic.opentlc.com
----

Then, you should create a playbook to execute the injector role, letâ€™s call if playbook-injector.yml, like this:
----

- name: Install lab manager on your target hosts
  hosts: target
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - lab-manager-injector
----

You may also add your own fork/branch of the lab manager repository as a variable if you have one.

Clone a copy of lab-manager-injector into a roles directory, which is in the same directory as your playbook.

The directory structure should look like this:

----
- playbook-injector.yml
- inventory
- roles
  - lab-maganer-injector
----

Then simply execute the playbook by running:

----
ansible-playbook playbook-injector.yml
----
